# Oncology Lifestyle Intervention Dashboard
An Interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing insights about the status of Oncology Treatments by analyzing data from a cancer clinical trial focused on lifestyle interventions. The dashboard tracks participant progression through the trial phases (Screening → Consent → Enrollment), and evaluates behavioral outcomes (diet and exercise) across various intervention arms.

The goal is to assist clinical operations teams and lifestyle researchers in understanding:

- Recruitment flow.
- Lifestyle behavior improvements.
- Site and cancer type-specific trends.
- Adverse event patterns across interventions.
